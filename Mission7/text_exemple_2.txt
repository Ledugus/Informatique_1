THREEPIO	Did you hear that?  They've shut down the main reactor.  We'll be destroyed for sure.  This is madness!
THREEPIO	We're doomed!
THREEPIO	There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.
THREEPIO	What's that?

LUKE	Hurry up!  Come with me!  What are you waiting for?!  Get in gear!
THREEPIO	Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?
THREEPIO	At last!  Where have you been?
THREEPIO	They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?  We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!
THREEPIO	Wait a minute, where are you going?
